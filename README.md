# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Objective

   Goal of the project is to analyse crowd funding data set using python, SQL ETL and query skills to answer key questions
    - Each contact of every live campaign to inform them of how much of the goal remains
    - Each backer of every live campaign to let them know how much of the goal remains for each campaign that theyâ€™ve pledged
